# setup-polly-jest

## Overview

This helper provides a convenient way to use [PollyJS][] (HTTP recording,
replaying and stubbing tool) in your Jest/Jasmine tests.

## Installation

This library has a peer dependency on `@pollyjs/core`. That means that you will
need to install it separately if you don't have it installed yet.

```sh
npm install --save-dev setup-polly-jest @pollyjs/core
```

## Usage

This helper behaves almost the same way as built-in [Mocha][] or [QUnit][]
helpers for [PollyJS][]. If you used them before, this API should be familiar to
you:

```js
/** @jest-environment setup-polly-jest/jest-environment-node */

import { setupPolly } from 'setup-polly-jest';

describe('google.com', () => {
  let context = setupPolly({
    /* default configuration options */
  });

  test('should be able to search', async () => {
    /**
     * The `setupPolly` test helper creates a new polly instance which you can
     * access via `context.polly`. The recording name is generated based on
     * the suite (module) and spec (test) names.
     */
    context.polly.configure({ recordIfMissing: true });

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/');
    await fillIn('#search', 'Awesome HTTP stubbing');
    await submit();

    expect(document.getElementById('search-result').textContent).toBe(
      'PollyJS'
    );
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    /**
     * The setupPolly test helper will call `context.polly.stop()` when your test
     * has finished.
     */
  });
});
```

To learn more about how to use PollyJS or what can you do with polly instance,
please refer to [PollyJS docs][polly-docs].

For real-world examples, check out ["Jest + Node Fetch"][jest-node-fetch] or
["Jest + Puppeteer"][jest-puppeteer] examples in PollyJS docs or [tests][] in
this repo.

## Supported Test Runners

This library supports `jasmine`, `jest-jasmine2` (default in `jest` <= 26), and
`jest-circus` (default in `jest` >= 27) [test runners][]. If you are using
`setup-polly-jest` with `jest-circus` runner you need to specify [custom test
environment][], either in the test file where you are planning to use
`setupPolly`:

```js
/** @jest-environment setup-polly-jest/jest-environment-node */

const context = setupPolly(/* ... */);
```

Or configure it for all your tests with `testEnvironment` config option

```js
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'setup-polly-jest/jest-environment-jsdom'
};
```

Both `node` and `jsdom` environments are provided by this library and can be
safely used as a replacement for original `jest-environment-*` environments.

## Test Hook Ordering

Accessing `context.polly` during a test run before the instance of Polly has
been created or after it was cleaned up produces the following error:

!> You are trying to access an instance of Polly that is not yet available.

If you need to do some work before the test run, you can access the instance of
Polly in `beforeEach` hook. If you need to do some work before the instance of
Polly gets cleaned up and removed, you can do so in `afterEach` hook.

```js
describe('test', () => {
  const context = setupPolly();

  beforeEach(() => {
    context.polly.server
      .get('/ping')
      .intercept((req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));
  });

  it('does a thing', async () => {
    expect(await fetch('/ping').status).toBe(200);
  });

  afterEach(() => context.polly.flush());
});
```

## Caveats

Although this library is thoroughly covered with unit and intergration tests,
its implementation in jasmine environment depends upon overwriting Jasmine
methods directly. That means that some _major_ changes in how Jest or Jasmine
run tests can lead to this library not working properly anymore.
